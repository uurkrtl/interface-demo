## Coding: Java Interfaces

Create a new Java project in IntelliJ (please only a backend application) and implement the following steps:

-   Step 1: Define an interface 'Playable' that contains a method 'play' without implementation.
-   Step 2: Create a class 'MusicPlayer' that implements the 'Playable' interface. Implement the 'play' method to play a song.
-   Step 3: Create a class 'VideoPlayer' that also implements the 'Playable' interface. Implement the 'play' method to play a video.
-   Step 4: Create a class 'MediaController' that contains a method 'playMedia'. This method should accept a 'Playable' object as a parameter and invoke the 'play' method.
-   Step 5: In the 'main' method, initialize an object of the 'MusicPlayer' and 'VideoPlayer' classes with the 'Playable' interface (polymorphism).
-   Step 6: In the 'main' method, create an object of the 'MediaController' class and use it to play both a song and a video.
